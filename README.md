# bipedal-robot-learning-collection  
+ This repo is a collection for high-quality robotics papers, with specialization on **bipedal robots** and **reinforcement learning** with **real robot experiments**. Papers on common learning techniques verified on quadrupedal robots, Bayesian optimization, CBF learning, etc., are temporarily excluded.       
+ I hope this can do a service for easy writing of literature review in papers. Abstracts or brief descriptions will later be added.     
+ Welcome to contribute by nominating new papers in Issues.
